## Mission

Create an application that allows logged-in users to work with employee accounts - updating status as far as training, access, employment, etc. Users can choose between multiple roles - manager or lead currently - and each role allows for different access levels. Managers can create create, update, and assign employees out to Leads, while Leads will access Assignee Lists to view available assignees, updating status when necessary. 

In a basic sense, simplify training and onboarding of new hires.
